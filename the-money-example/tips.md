Following are two of the three strategies I know for quickly getting to green:
- **Fake It** — Return a constant and gradually replace constants with variables until you have the real code.
- **Use Obvious Implementation** — Type in the real implementation.”

When we **triangulate**, we only generalize code when we have two examples or more. 
We briefly ignore the duplication between test and model code. 
When the second example demands a more general solution, then and only then do we generalize.
